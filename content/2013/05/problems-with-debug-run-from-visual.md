I had a problem while running debug+openmp configuration of my console. Meanwhile in Release+openmp configuration everything is ok. Diagnostic message I see is something about wrong parallel configurations, system log and sxstrace.exe.

The solution is following.
Folder
<blockquote class="tr_bq">Microsoft.VC90.DebugOpenMP</blockquote>with files
<blockquote class="tr_bq">Microsoft.VC90.DebugOpenMP.manifest
vcomp90d.dll&nbsp;</blockquote>were missing. I knew this problem for the folder I specify in debug properties in visual studio:
