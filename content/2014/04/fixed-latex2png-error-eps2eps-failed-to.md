OMG!! I finally fixed it.
Under Windows latex2rtf diisplayed following error:
```
latex2png: error: eps2eps failed to translate l2r_00123.pdf to l2r_00123.eps
```

for each image in my latex file.

That was very sad because this method is used to convert all equations, fugures and tables in word format.

The configurations seemed ok:

The problem was in eps2eps script in miktex. This script is magical. I haven't completely understood why it does nothing when called from latex2rtf. At the same time it runs successfuly when running standalone.


i wrote my new script `pdf2eps_my.bat` with the following contents:

```
"C:\Program Files (x86)\gs\gs9.05\bin\gswin32c.exe" -q -dNOCACHE -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH -dSAFER -sDEVICE=epswrite -sOutputFile=%2 %1
```

and changed script 

```
"c:\Program Files (x86)\latex2rtf\latex2png" 
```

I changed 

```
PDF2EPS="eps2eps" 
```

with 

```
PDF2EPS="pdf2eps_my" 
```

it works because miktex/bin directory is in my PATH
