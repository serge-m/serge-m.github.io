Here I will collect links to well-written articles about math and algorithms. 

[Visual Information Theory](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-09-Visual-Information/). Nice post about probabilities, entropy. The [whole blog](http://colah.github.io/) has awesome visualizations. Highly recommended.

[MNIST For ML Beginners](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/mnist/beginners) - Nice introduction into machine learning with TensorFlow

[Brilliantly wrong](http://arogozhnikov.github.io/) - blog by Alex Rogozhnikov, with fantastic visualizations of many algorithms and concepts

[Collection of data science notebooks](https://github.com/donnemartin/data-science-ipython-notebooks). 


[Deconvolution and Checkerboard Artifacts](https://distill.pub/2016/deconv-checkerboard/) by 
Odena, et al., 2016 - explanation of
deconvolution operation in neural networks with awesome interactive visualizations

[Up-sampling with Transposed Convolution](https://towardsdatascience.com/up-sampling-with-transposed-convolution-9ae4f2df52d0) one more article about deconvolutions with good examples

More about deconvolutions in Tensorflow on [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39373230/what-does-tensorflows-conv2d-transpose-operation-do)

[A guide to convolution arithmetic for deeplearning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.07285.pdf), Vincent Dumoulin, Francesco Visin, 2018
