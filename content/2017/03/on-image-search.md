Image storage and image similarity logic is implemented within independent, stateless micro-services.
Data is stored in postgres.
Clustering is based on histograms. 1 contributor. No tests. abandoned.

<cite>Java library that provides a simple way to retrieve images and photos based on color and texture characteristics. LIRE creates a Lucene index of image features for content based image retrieval (CBIR) using local and global state-of-the-art methods. Easy to use methods for searching the index and result browsing are provided. Best of all: it's all open source. </cite>
