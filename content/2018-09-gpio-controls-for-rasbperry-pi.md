### General

#### pigpio
The library also provides a service.
It can be useful if you don't want to give root access to the client applications and want to control PWM for example.

Here is how to create a system service for `pigpiod`:

Create file 
/etc/systemd/system/pigpiod.service: 

```
[Unit]
Description=pigpiod service

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/pigpiod -g -n localhost

RestartSec=5
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

```

run and check status

```bash
sudo systemctl start pigpiod.service
sudo systemctl status pigpiod.service
```

should be something like this:
```
● pigpiod.service - pigpiod service
   Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/pigpiod.service; enabled; vendor preset: enabled)
   Active: active (running) since Wed 2018-09-19 12:22:30 UTC; 1s ago
 Main PID: 10074 (pigpiod)
   CGroup: /system.slice/pigpiod.service
           └─10074 /usr/bin/pigpiod -l -g

```

Now enable the service:
```
sudo systemctl enable pigpiod.service
```

Now `pigpriod` has to run on startup of your raspberry pi and provide interface to gpio:
```
pigs w 4 1
```

If something went wrong and the pigpiod service doesn't start you will see
```bash
$ pigs w 4 1 
socket connect failed

```
