I was looking for a system monitoring solution that can notify my in case of abnormal CPU/netowrk/disk usage via email or telegram.

It seems there are several popular solutions:

* `Nagios <https://www.nagios.org/>`_

* `Munin <http://munin-monitoring.org/>`_

* `Icinga <https://www.icinga.org/>`_

* `Spiceworks <http://www.spiceworks.com/>`_

* `Monit <https://mmonit.com/monit/>`_

* `Cacti <http://www.cacti.net/>`_

* `Zabbix <http://www.zabbix.com/>`_

* `Glances <https://glances.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_
