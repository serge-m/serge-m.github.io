3D Packing for Self-Supervised Monocular Depth Estimation
--------------------------------------------------------------

by Vitor Guizilini, `pdf at arxiv <https://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.02693.pdf>`_, 2020


Learning

1. Depth estimator :math:`f_D : I \rightarrow D`

2. Ego motion estimator: :math:`f_x : (I_t , I_S) \rightarrow x_{t \rightarrow S}`



Depth Estimator
=====================================

They predict an inverse depth and use a packnet architecture.

Inverse depth probably has more stable results. Points far away from camera have small inverse depth that with low precision. The nearer points have  more information

Probably they assume that the scene is rigid and there is no moving objects. It is likely to give some errors for the moving objects. How do they deal with the moving objects?


Ego motion estimator
======================================

They use a rather simple CNN from SfMLearner.



Loss function
==================================
Loss function consists of three parts.
1. appearance loss
2. depth smoothness loss
3. velocity scaling loss

RealMonoDepth: Self-Supervised Monocular Depth Estimation for General Scenes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

self-supervised from stereo and mono.

They claim to be better than monodepth2 and mode generalized than depth_from_video_in_the_wild "Depth from Videos in the Wild".
However they require camera calibration and median depth to be estimated prior to processing with an external tool.
(`COLMAP <https://colmap.github.io/>`_). Not really "in the wild".

They were able to train on multiple scenes with different depth ranges.
The method still requires a static scene for the training. For example they use data from Mannequin Challenge
to train their models. Then the network can be used on dynamic scenes with people.

The code is not available so far.
