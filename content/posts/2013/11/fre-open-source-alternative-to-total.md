It seems I almost found alternative for [TotalCommander](http://www.ghisler.com/" target="_blank).
Let me present [DoubleCommander](http://doublecmd.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank).
It is free, open-source, extendible by Total's plugins. That's awesome.
I also found out that viewer plugin SGView for TotalCommander can be &nbsp;completely replaced by ImaginePlugin. Imagine has x64 version. The issue was to assign hotkeys like in SGView.
