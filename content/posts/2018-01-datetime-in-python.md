## Conversion from calendar week to date
Sometimes one has to convert a date written as year, calendar week (CW), and day of week to an actual date with month and date.
The behaviour in the begin/end of a year may be not straightforward.
For example according to ISO 8601 monday date of the CW 1 year 2019 is 31 January 2018.
As far as I can see there is no standard function for conversion in python.


I use the following hacky code:

```python
def year_cw_day_to_date(year: int, calendar_week: int, day_of_week: int):
    """
    year: integer number, e.g. 1986
    calendar_week: integer number, from 1 to 53
    day_of_week: integer starting from 1, so that 1 is Monday, 2 is Tuesday, ...,  7 is Sunday

    >>> year_cw_day_to_date(2019, 1, 1)
    datetime.date(2018, 12, 31)

    >>> year_cw_day_to_date(2019, 1, 7)
    datetime.date(2019, 1, 6)

    >>> year_cw_day_to_date(2018, 52, 7)
    datetime.date(2018, 12, 30)

    >>> year_cw_day_to_date(2018, 53, 2)
    datetime.date(2019, 1, 1)

    >>> year_cw_day_to_date(2018, 53, 0)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ...
    ValueError: day_of_week must be in range from 1 to 7
    """

    if day_of_week not in range(1, 8):
        raise ValueError("day_of_week must be in range from 1 to 7")
    string_representation = f"{year}-{calendar_week}-{day_of_week}"
    return datetime.datetime.strptime(string_representation, "%G-%V-%u").date()
```

It prints the week-based date to a string and then parses it using `%V` and `%u` format from python 3 ([docs](https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/datetime.html#strftime-and-strptime-behavior))
Therefore you don't need to implement ISO logic of dates calculation. Hopefully such a funciton apppear in standard library.

Python 2 doesn't have these `%V` and `%u` implemented. `:(`


## Measuring elapsed time

Python standard library has a set of functions to measure elapsed time.

One can get information about each function using `time.get_clock_info(name)`

|Clock   	    | Adjustable    | 	Monotonic 	|   Resolution 	        | Tick Rate
|---------------|---------------|---------------|-----------------------|-------------
|process_time 	| False         | True          | 1e-07 	            | 10,000,000
|clock 	     	| False         | True          | 4.665306263360271e-07 | 	2,143,482
|perf_counter 	| False 	    | True 	        | 4.665306263360271e-07 |	2,143,482
|monotonic 	    | False         | True 	        | 0.015625 	            |64
|time 	        | True 	        | False 	    | 0.015625 	            |64

source of measurements: [Python Clocks Explained](https://www.webucator.com/blog/2015/08/python-clocks-explained/), 2015.

`time.perf_counter()` gives the most accurate results when testing the difference between two times and pretty fast.
`timeit` uses `time.perf_counter()` by default.

`time.process_time()` can be helpful to understand how long different parts of a program took to run. 

> according to the PEP 0418, several modules use (or could use) time.monotonic(), 
> including concurrent.futures, multiprocessing, queue, subprocess, telnet and threading modules to implement timeout.
