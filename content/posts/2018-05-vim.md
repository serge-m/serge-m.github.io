set tabstop=4

You can replace all the tabs with spaces in the entire file with
```
:%retab
```

### Working with multiple files

    :bprev (of :bp) - go to previous buffer
    :bd - delete a buffer (close a file)

    ctrl+ww - switch between windows
    ctrl+wq - Quit a window
    ctrl+wv - Split windows vertically
    ctrl+wj - switch wo the bottom window
    ctrl+wk - switch wo the top window
    

### Paste without reformatting 

Vim provides the 'paste' option to aid in pasting text unmodified from other applications. You can set it manually like:
```
:set paste
```
paste, then

```
:set nopaste
```


### Upper/lower case transformation

`~` - Toggle case of the character under the cursor, or all visually-selected characters. 

`3~` Toggle case of the next three characters. 

`g~3w` Toggle case of the next three words. 

`g~iw` Toggle case of the current word (inner word â€“ cursor anywhere in word). 

`g~$` Toggle case of all characters to end of line. 

`g~~` Toggle case of the current line (same as V~). 

The above uses `~` to toggle case. In each example, you can replace `~` with `u` to convert to lowercase, or with `U` to convert to uppercase. For example:

`U` Uppercase the visually-selected text. 
    First press `v` or `V` then move to select text. 
    If you don't select text, pressing `U` will undo all changes to the current line. 

`gUU`
    Change the current line to uppercase (same as VU). 

`gUiw`
    Change current word to uppercase. 

`u`
    Lowercase the visually-selected text. 
    If you don't select text, pressing u will undo the last change. 

`guu`
    Change the current line to lowercase (same as Vu).
