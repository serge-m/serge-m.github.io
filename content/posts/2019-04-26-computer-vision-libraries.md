So, what else is there except for opencv...

### CCV 
[CCV website](libccv.org), [github](libccv.org)

CCV 0.7 comes with a sub-10% image classifier, a decent face detector.


> It runs on Mac OSX, Linux, FreeBSD, Windows*, iPhone, iPad, Android, Raspberry Pi. In fact, anything that has a proper C compiler probably can run ccv. The majority (with notable exception of convolutional networks, which requires a BLAS library) of ccv will just work with no compilation flags or dependencies.

List of algorithms:
* TLD: Track Learn Detect
* SWT: Stroke Width Transform
* SIFT: Scale Invariant Feature Transform
* SCD: SURF-Cascade Detection
* ICF: Integral Channel Features
* HTTP: A REST-ful API
* DPM: Deformable Parts Model
* ConvNet: Deep Convolutional Networks
* Cache: We are Terrible Magicians
* BBF: Brightness Binary Feature


### DLib

> [Dlib](http://dlib.net/) is a modern C++ toolkit containing machine learning algorithms and tools for creating complex software in C++ to solve real world problems. It is used in both industry and academia in a wide range of domains including robotics, embedded devices, mobile phones, and large high performance computing environments. Dlib's open source licensing allows you to use it in any application, free of charge.
