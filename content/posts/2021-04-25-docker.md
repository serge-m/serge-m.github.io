### rocker
A tool to run docker images with customized local support injected for things like nvidia support. And user id specific files for cleaner mounting file permissions.

## Build arguments

example Dockerfile:

    FROM busybox
    ARG user
    USER $user
    # ...
    
A user builds this file by calling:
    
    $ docker build --build-arg user=what_user .


## .dockerignore

> Docker CLI will only look for .dockerignore file in the root directory of the context 

[Official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#dockerignore-file)
