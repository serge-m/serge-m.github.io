A working solution to recognize a couple of pages scanned text (or photos with text) in Ubuntu 20:


    # install tesseract
    sudo apt install tesseract-ocr

    # find module with the language you need
    apt-cache search tesseract-ocr 

    # Let's say we need german. Then we install
    sudo apt install tesseract-ocr-deu

    # Install GUI tool
    sudo apt install ocrfeeder



The interface is relatively simple. It may require setting the default language in the settings.
