In order to know where to put efforts, time and money one has to understand which areas of 
technology, science and culture are experiencing break-through and which are stagnating.

In a booming sector/country/company everything is helping to reach a success. Even if you are 
a mediocre specialist you probably gain a good portion of experience and the career can go higher.

During a crisis you easlity get unlucky even if you are high-profile expert. Your environment possibly only thinks
about survival or cutting costs and your expertise is not valued.

I think definitely hit the right spot by getting expertise in software and computers.

I was pretty close to the peak hype waves of 3D cinema, machine learning, self-driving cars, 
although maybe not in ideal position, and I didn't squeese 100% of those opportunities.

I definitely missed opportunities to work on social networks, smartphones, web, e-commerce. Mostly because 
the areas weren't so interesting for me.

What is next big thing? Here I'll try to write down my thoughts about the future. 
I hope I should be not much worse in predicting the future than many other "experts" on the internet.

Also writing down some ideas helps me to unload them from my head. Otherwize they are 
just buzzing there and that bothers me.




## Technology

#### Computers

Development of personal computers has slowed down a lot. 
CPU frequency doesn't grow anymore. Amount of RAM and disk space almost stopped.
We reached certain limits here. The main development happens on 
power efficiency and parallel computing.

Those two aspects are really interconnected. In order to put more computing power  into
one device they have to be more efficient, allow for normal battery life and don't get on fire.

Development of the batteries cannot keep up with the growing compute. I think batteries have 
more physical limitations than putting more compute in a limited small box. It's another 
reason why better batteries don't solve the problem of power efficiency.


We went from state/business operated **shared** computers to **personal** wearable computer devices.
The devices also are interconnected in a global network. Therefore we are talking here
about mixed **shared-personal** usage type.

Withing that ecosystem there are some technologies that are still in the **shared** mode.


#### Search engines

The market is dominated by a couple of big world-scale players. The main one is google of course.



I suppose there should be a change in that. Personal computers became pretty powerful. And they can handle
