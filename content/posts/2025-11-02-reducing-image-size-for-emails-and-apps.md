It's been a long time...

I just wanted to share a project that my friends built with a bit of my guidance:

[imagesize.memohub.pro/](https://imagesize.memohub.pro/)

Basically it's a small web app that takes a bunch of images and compresses them to a neccessary size. Processing happens in a browser. Your images and photos stay in your computer and they are never uploaded to any server. It can be handldy when you need to attach many photos to an email, or there is a limitation on file size in visa application.

I use it sometimes too.
