<p>Robocar runs on <a href="https://www.ros.org/">Robot Operating System</a> (ROS).
I use Ubuntu image with <a href="https://downloads.ubiquityrobotics.com/pi.html">preinstalled ROS from ubiquity</a>.

In the future I&rsquo;ll probably add some more user-friendly interface for that.</p>
<p>The system consists of the following nodes.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>raspicam_node</code> - captures the images from Raspberry Pi camera and publishes to a ROS topic</p>

<li>
<p>listening for PWM commands produced by ai_driver and translated by steering_translator</p>
</li>
<li>
