      <description>In school we round numbers like 0.5, 1123.5 towards the bigger number. It&amp;rsquo;s a &amp;ldquo;round half up&amp;rdquo; method.
That introduces an undesired bias some cases. For example if we have a large data set, and we aggregate some column containing a lot of .5 fractions. In order to adjust for it in many cases a rounding of 0.5 towards nearest even number is applied. It&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Rounding half to even&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;banker&amp;rsquo;s rounding&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>With the help of python and SymPy module one can do pretty neat computations. For example when I took a course about Robotic Preception on Coursera I had to find a cross product of two vectors v1 x v2 represented in a generic form:
v1 = (a, b, c) v2 = (d, e, 0) Normally I would write it down on a piece of paper and do the computations myself. Luckily python can help with that.</description>
