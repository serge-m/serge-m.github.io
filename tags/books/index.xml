      <description>Resources (books, tutorials, etc.) A half-hour to learn Rust - blog post, a great intro into the language. It may be enough to start reading the code, but not enough for writing.
Easy Rust â€” a book about rust
Many companies and people now learn Rust, and they could learn faster with a book that has easy English. This textbook is for these companies and people to learn Rust with simple English.</description>

      <description>Super harsh guide to machine Learning Super harsh guide to machine learning (reddit)
First, read fucking Hastie, Tibshirani, and whoever. Chapters 1-4 and 7. If you don&amp;rsquo;t understand it, keep reading it until you do.
You can read the rest of the book if you want. You probably should, but I&amp;rsquo;ll assume you know all of it.
Take Andrew Ng&amp;rsquo;s Coursera. Do all the exercises in Matlab and python and R.</description>

      <description>There must be some kind of rating here. Maybe later&amp;hellip;
Done The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck: A Counterintuitive Approach to Living a Good Life by Mark Manson.
Download at amazon.
Read 2022.
It seems to me this is a shorter, a bit more rude version of &amp;ldquo;Seven habits&amp;rdquo; for millennials. I like the book. I guess it is even too short for me to unpack some of the ideas while I was listening to the audio version.</description>
