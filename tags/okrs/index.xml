      <description>We had a production system written by mathematicians, 50 different stakeholders with conflicting targets, five leadership changes during last year, a dozen of microservices, AWS costs of 10 thousands per week,
hole galaxy of legacy databases, cron jobs, Celery, greenlets, â€¦ Also, unstable API as a dependency, 10 Gb of text dumps as output, user input without validation, false alarms in monitoring, and two dozen unprotected public endpoints. Not that we needed all that for the work, but once you get locked into a serious agile development, the tendency is to push it as far as you can.</description>
