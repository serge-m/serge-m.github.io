      <description>How to make an engineer to accept your crazy idea Invite him/her to a 2-6 hours meeting. It may also be several meeting. But within one day. The important meeting has to be the last in the row. Don&amp;rsquo;t send an agenda beforehand. They might prepare themselves. It is better to be spontaneous. Speak loud. The louder you are, the smarter you seem. Don&amp;rsquo;t bring any objective proofs or measurements that support your idea.</description>

      <description>why does your data science project fail again Your data scientists aren&amp;rsquo;t real scientists

No progress proven == no need for changes at all.
You don&amp;rsquo;t perform reproducible experiments</description>
