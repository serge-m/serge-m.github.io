      <description>For the robocar contest in Berlin I started a project of building an autonomous toy car (scale 1:10). The goal of the contest was to show the fastest lap driving autonomously. The track had 8-shape with lane boundaries marked with white tape.
Unfortunately the competition got cancelled. But that gave me an opportunity to switch from my 1st gen car to 2nd gen version.
Here is my first version:
The second version is built upon a stock RC car Absima Abs1</description>

      <description>ROS on raspberry pi There is a compiled image for RPi by ubiquity that has ROS kinetic: https://downloads.ubiquityrobotics.com/pi.html.
It seems for me too old. It&amp;rsquo;s 2020, there are ubuntu 18, ros melodic and ros2, next year the support of python2.7 will be discontinued. Meh&amp;hellip;
It is possible to have ROS melodic on Raspberry Pi 3 B+. See in the next sections.
Installing tensorflow for ROS on raspberry pi Alternatively one can try to install it from wheels: https://www.</description>
